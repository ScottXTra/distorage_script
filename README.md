# Project Name
Distorage
# About 
Abuse Discords CDN for unlimited free cloud storage with low read/write speed. Also unlimited file size upload for any account (including non nitro) this is achieved by splitting the file into parts behind the scenes. This is a POC
# Built With 
Python
# Future Plans 
Leverage basic functionality to incorporate folder monitoring and potentially emulate a (very slow but, infinity large) hard drive (platform dependent) 
# Note
No error handling but pretty hard to mess up tbh (I wrote this [and reverse engineered the discord client API] in the last 6 hours)(Also probably spelling errors)
